Last sunday, it was a fine day. My friend and I went to Mount Daifu.
In the morning,we rode bikes to the foot of the mountain.After a short rest,we climbed the mountain.on its peak,
we shared the beautiful scenery in our eyes.

There were lots of light foggy clouds around us.What's more, varieties of birds flying around us were pretty.
What a harmony situation! At noon,we had lunch in a restaurant. With a happy emotion, we finished our climbing.
Although tired, we still felt happy and relaxed.we hope our country will become more and more beautiful.
